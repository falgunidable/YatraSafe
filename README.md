A Application in the Travel and Health domain



Health is an important factor of our life. And in this pandemic, it is much more important and not safe. This application focuses on the travelers, which travel from city to city in order to complete their work within the time period they have. Travelers, here are the venders, marketing agents, dealers, for their trading, then merchants, etc. the list goes on. The application based on the state, here Maharashtra, provides city where we might be travelling and then based on which city we have chosen, the details are displayed. For that particular city the details are separate. It provides the current, recovered cases and deaths of that city, then spreads awareness about the spreading of COVID, then provides doctorâ€™s details, if by chance they get infected and want to have them get checked. It also helps them check if they are infected by the COVID or not, by providing details about it. Doctors and patients get connected easily, either through a phone call, or by having a visit. Points are awarded to the admin on the rating of a particular comment.
